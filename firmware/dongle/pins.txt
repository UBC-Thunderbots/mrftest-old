#
# Each line of this file (except those starting with #) defines a single pin
# on the microcontroller.
#
# First token is the application name of the pin.
# Second token is the physical location of the pin (e.g. "RA0").
# Third token is the type of pin.
#
# Legal types are:
#  in   - pin should be configured as an input at startup
#  out0 - pin should be configured as an output low at startup
#  out1 - pin should be configured as an output high at startup
#  vgnd - pin should be configured as a virtual ground (name/polarity are ignored)
#  vvdd - pin should be configured as a virtual VDD (name/polarity are ignored)
